pixelart-dev

this is my project to make pixel art happen for every one.
I use jekyll sass and javascript

I took a template from devtips (great video about making a website with jekyll).
It is not finished at all. I like to use some of the sections. therfore some of the parts appear not to be mine. I will either convert them or delete them.

Thank you for contributing!

Sebastian.
